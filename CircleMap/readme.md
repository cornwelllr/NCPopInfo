### My Interactive Web Map
#### For my web map I chose to take all of the counties in NC and figure out what their populations are from the most updated information that I could find. 

### Major Functions
* Interactive Web map to examine the population for the counties of North Carolina
* Proportional Symbol representing the population sizes
* Legend to decipher the map and the proportional symbols
### Data
* NC One Map
* US Census Bureau Data
* Wikipedia (latitude and longitude)

### Libraries
* Leaflet Version 1.9.4 (most updated)
* jQuery v3.1.1
* Leaflet Demo Provider (basemap)
* Google Maps as data for Lat & Long

## Reflection
During this lab, I found myself not feeling quite as lost. However, I did struggle with data collection. What worked well for me was that I found data for county populations but had to import the information for latitude and longitude to create points for myself. This took quite a while considering that NC has one hundred counties. I do wonder if there was a more efficient way to do this instead of looking it up one by one. I had a slight bit of trouble with formatting for my csv file to get the geojson reader to accept my points to be able to convert it for leaflet to read it. After following the lab documents from 9&10, I managed to understand the map building process. I struggled a small bit with the legend portion of the map but I figured it out with some troubleshooting. Overall, it was good for this lab to have a final map that I was proud of and this was an enjoyable lab.
